# Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project is a **handwritten digit classifier** built using **TensorFlow.js** and **HTML5 Canvas**. Users can draw digits on a canvas, and the model predicts the digit using a pre-trained MNIST dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict digits drawn on a canvas.
- Save your drawing as a PNG file.
- Track prediction accuracy with real-time updates.
- Interactive and responsive UI design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Responsive and attractive design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and TensorFlow.js integration.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Deep learning in the browser.
